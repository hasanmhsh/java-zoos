1-Add liquibase dependency to your pom file as following regarding last version

    <dependency>
	    <groupId>org.liquibase</groupId>
	    <artifactId>liquibase-core</artifactId>
	    <version>${liquibase.version}</version>
	</dependency>

2-(Optional) Liquibase Maven plugins which is added to pom file is a tool which is used independently from your app by you with mvn command to execute data migration

                <plugin>
                    <groupId>org.liquibase</groupId>
                    <artifactId>liquibase-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                    <version>${liquibase.version}</version>
                    <configuration>
                        <propertyFile>src/main/resources/liquibase.properties</propertyFile>
                    </configuration>
                </plugin>

    A-You can use liquibase maven plugin to generate changelog for existing database with the following mvn command
        #   mvn liquibase:generateChangeLog
        the contents of liquibase.properties should be as following (configured inside plugin configuration element)
                    url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/oauth_reddit
                    username=tutorialuser
                    password=tutorialmy5ql
                    driver=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
                    outputChangeLogFile=src/main/resources/liquibase-outputChangeLog.xml
    B-You can use liquibase maven plugin to generate changelog file which reflects the difference between two databases with the following maven command:
        #	mvn liquibase:diff
        he contents of liquibase.properties should be as following (configured inside plugin configuration element)
                    changeLogFile=src/main/resources/liquibase-changeLog.xml
                    url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/oauth_reddit
                    username=tutorialuser
                    password=tutorialmy5ql
                    driver=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
                    referenceUrl=jdbc:h2:mem:oauth_reddit
                    diffChangeLogFile=src/main/resources/liquibase-diff-changeLog.xml
                    referenceDriver=org.h2.Driver
                    referenceUsername=sa
                    referencePassword=

3-Add Hibernate to maven liquibase plugin to reflect our model into database and handle versioning but you should use a long variable inside your model classes to change it when any changes applied tou your model class
    A-First add that dependency to your liquibase maven plugin
